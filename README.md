BookList helps users keep track of their reading lists. There are three sections to this single page app: an about section with a brief description, a profile section for user's information, and a booklist. Users can add new titles to the list via a collapsable form and edit or delete each title. 

This site is a work in process. In the current iteration, the profile section is static and only the book list can be added to or edited. Ultimately, this app will have:

  1. separate book lists for books that have been read and an unread titles that a user wishes to read
  2. a checkbox next to the title information that will move the book list item from the READ list to the UNREAD list
  3. the ability to have multiple user profiles with individualized book lists.

To view this site on your local machine, the node packages will need to be installed using npm install in the terminal.
  1. In the root directory of the project, run "npm install"
  2. Using a second window, start the mongo service by running "mongod"
  3. To start the app server process, run nodemon
  4. Open a localhost window on port 8080
