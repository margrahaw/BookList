BookList helps users keep track of their reading lists. There are two sections to this single page app: a profile section and a booklist. Users can add new titles to the list. 

This site is a work in process. The immediate goal is to be able to list, edit, add, or delete titles in the book list. Other ideas I have for the app is to:

  1. have separate book lists for books that have been read and those that have already been read
  2. add a checkbox to the title information that will move the titles from one list to the other 

To view this site on our local machine, the node packages will need to be installed using npm install in the terminal.
